Welcome pphilippersson6,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!


# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a very simple website where you can play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
You play against the computer. The winner is determined by the classic game-rules.

Try it yourselves here! [ Rock, Paper, Scissor Game!](https://pphilippersson6.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

# Usage

##
- The player is prompted to enter the number of rows and columns they want to play with (between 1 and 10).
- A game board is created for both the player and the computer.
- The computer randomly places its battleship on its board.
- The game then proceeds for four turns, with the player and the computer taking turns to guess the location of the other's battleship.
- If a guess hits the other player's battleship, they win the game. Otherwise, the game continues until all four turns are completed.
- After the game is finished, the player can choose to play again or quit, by pressing y or n.

## Game Rules

Battleship is a two-player guessing game where each player tries to sink the other's hidden ships.
The game board is a grid of squares, in this game you can play up to 10x10 squares.
The players ships are randomly generated by the computer. Those ships are hidden from the enemy.

You atake turns calling out the column and rows where you think the ship are located (from row, column 0, up to row and column 10).
If a player hits all of the squares of a ship, the ship is considered "sunk".
The first player to sink all of the other player's ships wins the game.
